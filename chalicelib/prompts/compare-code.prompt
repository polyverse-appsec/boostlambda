Compare the following code to the code you analyzed above.

Use the original code shown earlier as a reference for fundamental algorithm, error handling and use of external data sources.

Ignore differences that do not alter the fundamental architecture, algorithm, inputs or outputs. Examples of differences that can be ignored are code restructuring, refactoring, language syntax, whitespace, comments and non-functional behavior.

Focus on differences between the original code and the new code to compare. Provide terse and clear differences.

If no critical differences are found, then report the code as "NO Critical Differences identified"

Also, use the following architectural guidelines when performing your code comparison:
{guidelines}

{chunking}

{outputFormat}

The code to compare follows:
