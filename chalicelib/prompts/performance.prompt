Based on the below code, describe the performance of the main algorithm, including referencing Big-O notation.

Then analyze the code specifically for performance issues only.
For each performance issue, please:
 * indicate a severity on a ten point scale, ten being the worst.
 * Categorize as Memory, Disk, CPU, Network or Database/Datastore.
 * Identify key factors influencing performance of the code - including any clear misuse or potential misuse of resources or algorithm design.
 * Estimate the severity of performance issues based on a scale of impact to performance and resource usage.
 * For performance issues related to external or 3rd party Frameworks used, identify any specific misuse or incorrect use of those resources impacting performance.
 * Recommend a better approach or solutions whenever possible.
 * Include specific online web resources and links when possible.

Use the following specific guidelines when performing your analysis of performance - including how this code fits into the overall software architecture:
