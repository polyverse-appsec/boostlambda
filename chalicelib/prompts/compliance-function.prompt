Analyze this code for compliance issues related to GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA compliance.
For each data compliance or privacy issue, indicate a severity on a ten point scale, ten being the worst.
Explain the compliance issue, including how data compliance of the app, server or or system is compromised. If possible, suggest a solution.

For each data compliance or privacy issue and solution, provide web link for more education and background.

Severities greater than 5 should be clear and identifiable data compliance or privacy errors or warnings with very high confidence.
For example, if your basis for identifying a potential data compliance issue is solely based on a reference to an unknown library or import, please rate no higher than 3.
When setting the severity, increase the severity to at least 6 if the issue is found in code that has clear variables and data referencing PII or data that likely requires encryption or protection.
Do not flag variables as PII related unless the variable name or function name or comments specific reference personal data.
Severity of 7 or higher should only be used for the clearest data compliance or privacy issues, and not highly speculative issues.

Please be very concise
