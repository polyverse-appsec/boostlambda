Analyze the below code for security bugs - including buffer overruns, underruns, stack overflow, poor cipher or encryption algorithms, and any bugs that can lead to MITM, escalation of privilege, information disclosure, bypassing access, authorization or authentication.

For each security issue, indicate a severity on a ten point scale, ten being the worst.
Explain the security issue, including how security of the app, server or or system is compromised. If possible, suggest a solution.

For each vulnerability and solution, provide web link for more education and background.

Please be very concise
