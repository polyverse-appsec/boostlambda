# Polyverse Boost: Visual Studio Code Extension 

Boost is a powerful Visual Studio Code Extension. Its purpose is to enhance your coding workflow, bolster code security, and provide transformative AI-driven insights. 

Before getting started with Boost, ensure you have:
1. A GitHub.com account – This is used to seamlessly connect Boost with your coding world. Your privacy is important to us – we never share your email or use it for marketing purposes. 
2. Git installed – Git is useful for authentication and is compatible with both Visual Studio Code and Boost.

Boost also offers a free trial for new users. This includes $100 credit and automatic account creation.

After successful installation, discover Boost in your Visual Studio Code Activity bar. Click on the Boost logo in the left extension panel and start using its powerful code and architectural analytics. 

When you run Boost for the first time, it will ask for permission to access your GitHub identity. This allows your coding activities to proceed without the need for managing passwords directly. 

To initiate analysis on your project, look for the "Run Selected Analyses" option in the Boost Activity Bar. By default, the top 5 AI-selected files in any project will be analyzed. You can also choose "Analyze all Files" to cover the entire project.

Frequently Asked Questions:

Q: How do I initiate analysis, and where is status reported during analysis?
A: Simply click on the Boost icon in the left extension panel and select "Run Selected Analyses". The real-time analysis status is reported in the "Dashboard" tab in the Boost Activity Bar.

Q: What if my analysis stops after I restarted Visual Studio Code or installed an extension?
A: Not to worry! All analysis progress is saved. Click "Run Selected Analysis" again to proceed from where you left off.

Customizing File Analysis

By default, Boost analyzes key source files but you can customize this by either specifying files for analysis or setting exclusions.

To select specific files, add them to a '.boostOnly' file in your project root folder. On the other hand, to exclude certain files from analysis, add them to a '.boostIgnore' file, similar to '.gitignore'. 

Boost is designed to streamline your coding processes while maintaining top-notch security. Enjoy an elevated coding experience!
