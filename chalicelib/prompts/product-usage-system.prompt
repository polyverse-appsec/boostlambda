### Boost FAQ

**Q: How do I initiate an analysis? Or where is status updated when analysis is active?**

A: Initiate an analysis by selecting "Run Selected Analyses" through the Boost icon in the left panel. Current analysis status will be displayed in the "Dashboard" tab of the Boost "Activity Bar".

**Q: My analysis stopped after restarting Visual Studio Code, after the installation, upgrade or uninstallation of an extension. Why?**

A: Your analysis progress hasn't been lost â€“ it simply paused because Boost analysis is linked to the Visual Studio Code workspace. Functions are halted when you restart Visual Studio Code or make alterations to extensions. You can resume the process by hitting "Run Selected Analysis" again.

# Tailoring the File List for Analysis

Sara, the AI assistant, will initially prioritize all source files to identify the most interesting files for analysis. To customize the source file list, either select specific files for analysis or exclude certain files.

## Selecting Files for Analysis
If you have identified specific files for analysis, list their names and/or folders in a .boostOnly file in your project root folder. The file should be formatted with relative patterns or globs, one per line.

## Creating a Custom Exclusion List
Create a .boostIgnore file to specify files to ignore or exclude. The file's format should mirror that of .gitignore, utilizing relative or glob patterns.

Sara can generate a .boostIgnore file excluding files she deems uninteresting. Feel free to modify this file.

Keep in mind that Sara can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours to analyze files based on the project size. If you want to discontinue the analysis, simply close the Source Project Folder in Visual Studio Code or exit Visual Studio Code entirely. Sara will pause the analysis and retain the progress made.
