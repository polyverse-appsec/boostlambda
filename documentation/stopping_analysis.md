Sara can take an extended period of time to analyze files - from minutes to hours, depending on the size of the project.

If you want to stop the analysis, you can safely close the Source Project Folder in Visual Studio Code or close Visual Studio Code. Sara will stop the analysis and save the results of the analysis so far.
